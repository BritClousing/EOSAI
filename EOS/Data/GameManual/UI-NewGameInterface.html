<h1>Game Settings</h1>
<img align="ABSMIDDLE" HSPACE=11 src="UI-Map.bmp">Map Settings:<br><br>
<p>Players can play a game on a randomly generated map, load a map, or load a scenario.</p>
<br>
<p class="Bullet">"Generate Random Map" makes the computer generate a new map at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p class="Bullet">"Load Map" allows players to load pre-existing maps from a file.</p>
<p class="Bullet">"Load Scenario" allows players to load pre-existing map from a file, but it contains units and cities already assigned to players.  This is useful for historical simulations, but, if the scenario favors one player, it can also result in one player having a major advantage in the game.</p>
<br>
<img align="ABSMIDDLE" HSPACE=12 src="Calendar.png">Date-Time Format:<br><br>
<p>The Game can either display the current turn number (1,2,3,...), or a date ("December 7, 1941").  Dates progress according to the "Day/Turn" setting.
For example, picking "2 Days/Turn" means that each turn increases the date by two days - e.g. "December 7, 1941" to "December 9, 1941".</p>
<br>
<img align="ABSMIDDLE" HSPACE=5 src="UI-TankIcon.bmp">Ruleset:<br><br>
<p>Empires of Steel can be played with a variety of units and technologies.  The default ruleset is "Offical 1900-2030".</p>
<br>
<img align="ABSMIDDLE" HSPACE=12 src="UI-Flags.bmp">Players:<br><br>
<p>A game can contain between 2 and 10 players.</p>
<br>
<p class="Bullet">Flag: This is the flag that the player will use.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Player Type: Players can either be human, a weak AI, moderate AI, or strong AI.  "AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is another word for "computer player".</p>
<p class="Bullet">Player Name: The name of the player.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Production: This gives a production bonus or penalty to that player.  A player who has 120% production has a 20% bonus to all city production.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Resources: At the beginning of the game, a player starts with some resources (normally 100 resources of each type).  Adjusting this number will change the player's initial resource amounts.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Units: Some rulesets have nation-specific technologies, buildings, and units.  This value determines which nation-specific technologies the player will use.  (Example: A World War 2 ruleset might contain "American", "British", "German", "Japanese", and "Russian" units.  Each player should have access to the units appropriate to the nation they control.)</p>
