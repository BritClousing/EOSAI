<H1>Map Editor Interface</H1>
<p>

The Map Editor allows users to create maps and scenarios.<br><br>

<b>Maps</b> contain geography, resources, and cities.  
It does not contain units or assign ownership to the cities or resources. 
Maps contain "Start Locations". Start Locations created by inside the map editor before a map can be played. 
Players are randomly assigned to Start Locations when the game begins. 
A game cannot contain more players than Start Locations.
<br>
<b>Scenarios</b> are similar to maps, except that units can be placed on the map 
and nationalities can be assigned to cities, resources, and units.  
Start Locations are not used in scenarios.
<br><br>
The Map Editor initially opens in 'map mode'.  To switch the editor between 'map mode' 
and 'scenario mode', open the Map Settings window.<br><br><b>Map Editor Tools</b>
