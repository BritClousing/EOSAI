<H1>Image Editor</H1>
<p>The Image Editor allows users to add new unit images to the game.
<br><br>
To add a new unit image to the game, press "Add" in the lower left corner.  You will be asked to name the unit image.  
The new image will appear at the bottom of the list (left column).
<br><br>
<b>Image Center</b> - this is used to align the unit image with the unit location.  Units should be aligned correctly inside the 
zone-of-control circle shown.  The alignment of units depends on how the 
unit-image is positioned within the png file.  For example, the "Bomber (Class 1)" unit is centered at location 32,24 of
the png images.  On the other hand, the Infantry images are centered at location 32,34 of the png images.  (These images
are stored inside "Data\Images\Units\Bomber (Class 1)\Bomber1-00**.png" and "Data\Images\Units\Infantry\Infantry1-00**.png".)
All unit images should be centered around the same location in every file used by that image.
<br><br>
<b>View</b> - this is used to display the unit image in various situations.
<br><br>
If you are loading unit images into the system, select <b>"Add Base Images"</b>.  All units need a base image.  For example, the infantry's 
base images are stored in the series of files "Data\Images\Units\Infantry\Infantry1-00**.png".  There are 16 rotations of the
infantry image (numbered 0 through 15).  Select any image in the series (i.e. "Infantry1-0000.png" through "Infantry1-0015.png" and 
the system will automatically find the other images).
<br><br>
To add unit-movement animations, select <b>"Add Movement Animation"</b>.  The game has one unit that has movement animations -
the infantry unit.  The movement animation shows the infantry man walking in a loop, shown in 16 different rotations.  These
animations can be viewed in the files "Data\Images\Units\Infantry\Infantry3-walk-r**-f00**.png".  The "r" value is the rotation
and the "f" value is the frame.  The infantry walk has 16 rotations (numbered 0 through 15) and 31 frames (numbered 0-30). Selecting
any of the images (example: "Infantry3-walk-r02-f0010.png") will load the entire series.  The game will automatically discover
all the rotations and animation frames used in the animation.  There must be 16 rotations, and all rotations must have the same
number of frames.
<br><br>
To add static combat animations, select <b>"Add Static Combat Image"</b>.  Static combat images are used when a unit is in combat, and
the combat animation is not running.  In the normal game, only the infantry has a static combat image.  This is the image of the 
infantryman holding his rifle and aiming.  The infantry also has a combat animation of the gun firing (see below).  When the animation
of a shooting gun is not playing, the static image is displayed.  In contrast, tanks do not use a static combat animation.  Instead,
they have combat animations, and when the combat animation is not playing, the base-image is displayed.  Example: The Infantry unit uses 
the format "Infantry3-fire-r**.png".  Selecting any of these images will automatically load the series.
<br><br>
To add combat animations, select <b>"Add Combat Animation"</b>.  Combat animations are named, so you can add multiple combat animations
for a single unit.  This makes it possible to use different combat animations for different enemies.  Example: The Infantry unit uses
the format "Infantry3-fire-r**-f00**.png".  Selecting any of these images will automatically load the series.
<br><br>
<b>Current Rotation</b> - this is used to view the image from different rotations.  It can be useful for centering the image and verifying
what the unit-image will look like inside the game.
<br><br>
<b>Default Rotation</b> - the default rotation is used to display the image on the interface.  For example, when units appear in the game's
unit-bar or in the left column, all units appear with a particular rotation.  Most units have a rotation of 10 - which is facing down
and to the left.  A few units appear in different directions - infantry appear straight forward (rotation 8), and artillery face up
and to the left (rotation 12).
<br><br>
<b>Pause Between Combat Animations</b> - The pause between combat animations is used to determine how often a unit performs a combat animation.
This can be a single value, or a series of values separated by commas (see the infantry for an example).  A pause of 0.2 means that
the unit should pause 0.2 turns between performing a combat animation.  If a series of values is used, then a pause is randomly selected 
from the list, which adds a little variety.  For example, infantry will pause betwen 0.15 and 0.36 turns between animations.
