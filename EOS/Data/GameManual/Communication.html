<H1>Communication</H1>

<p>Communication between players takes three forms: Voicechat, Mail, and Instant Messages.  Voicechat and Instant Messages 
are done through the communication window which appears in the lower left corner of the game interface.</p>

<H2>Mail</H2>

<p>Mail messages, which is similar to email, can be sent between players.  Mail messages allow players to setup
trade agreements, talk, and declare war.  The "Mail" button appears on the left side of the Game Interface, and it
opens up the Mail Interface.

<H2>Voicechat</H2>

<p>Voicechat allows players to communicate verbally using a headset (or speakers and a microphone).  Players who have
speakers but no microphone can hear, but not respond to other players.  Chosing who you are talking to is done through
the "Voicechat/IM Target" button.
<br><br>
Ignoring Players:<br>
It's possible to turn-off incoming voicechat from other players (all of them or one in particular). 
This is done through the "Speaker/Microphone Settings" button.
</p>
<H2>Instant Messages</H2>
<p>Instant messages to other players are the simplest way to talk to other players.  Messages that you send will appear
on other player's screens, overlaying the map.  Like voicechat, the "Voicechat/IM Target" button determines who will
receive the message.  Instant Messages are limited to 250 characters, and cannot be used to setup trade agreements.  
Instant Messages can be sent by clicking on the "Write IM" button (which opens up a text editing area), typing a message, and 
pressing [Enter].
<br><br>
The "Instant Message Log" provides a way to go back and read past IMs.  This is especially useful because of the fact that
Instant Messages appear on player's screens for a limited time.
