<p>Nations can be involved in a number of different relationships.</p>
<H2>War</H2>
<P>
When nations are at war, units are allowed to attack and auto-attack that player (auto-attack is controlled by <a href="FieldOrders.html">field orders</a>). 
There are two ways to start a war with another player.  Both are accessible from the Foreign Relations window.
<br>
- Players can explicitly "Declare War".
<br>
- Players can setup "sneak attack" orders against another player.  When the sneak attack happens, both nations
switch to "at war".
</p>
<H2>Neutral</H2>
<P>
When a nation has a neutral stance towards another nation, its units will not attack that player.  However, if that
other nation attacks, your own foreign policy will automatically switch to "war".
</p>
<H2>Alliance</H2>
<P>
When nations are allied, their units will not attack each other.  Additionally, allies can land/dock units in each other's
cities, and units can be repaired and upgraded there.
<br><br>
Alliances can be broken at any time.  This means former allies can become enemies.  
<br><br>
Alliances are created through the message / trade agreement system.
</p>
<H2>Team</H2>
<p>
A Team is similar to an Alliance, except that a team can contain an unlimited number of players, is permanent, and 
allows players (in the team) to win the game together.
<br><br>
Teams are created through the foreign relations / team window.
<br><br>
Teams can be setup inside a scenario.  This is useful for creating historical scenarios where players have 
predetermined alliances.  For example, in a World War 2 scenario, Germany, Italy, and Japan would 
be grouped into the "Axis" team, while the US, Britian, and the USSR would be put into the "Allies" team.
