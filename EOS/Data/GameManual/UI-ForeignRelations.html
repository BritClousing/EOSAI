<H2>How To Read The Interface</H2>

In this example, we have two other players: Rommel and Patrishimoto.  On the left, below Rommel's name
is the description "(98) Good Friends".  This is Rommel's attitude towards you.  The numerical value ("98")
ranges from 0 (hated) to 100 (friends).  Patrishimoto, on the other hand, dislikes you.
<br><br>
The "Your Relations" column shows your official relations with the player. You are at peace with Rommel, and at war with Patrishimoto.
<br><br>
The "Foreign Relations" column shows each players relations to other players.  Rommel is not a part of any team, is at war with Patrishimoto, 
and has no alliances.  Patrishimoto is at war with you ("Sherman") and Rommel.
<br><br>
The "Actions" column lets players interact with that player - declaring war on them, sending
a message, or trading with them (available through the "Send Message" interface).
<br><br>
Foreign Relations can be changed by these actions:
<p class="Bullet">Forming Alliances (through an Agreement; requires permission from the other player),</p>
<p class="Bullet">Peace Agreements (through an Agreement; requires permission from the other player),</p>
<p class="Bullet">Making a Declaration of War (done unilaterally, this switches your nation's policy towards another nation to 'war', the other nation can choose whether or not to change their official status towards you),</p> 
<p class="Bullet">Giving your units orders to attack another player (both sides switch to war status when the attack occurs),</p>
<p class="Bullet">Trading with a Player (improves the other players attitude towards you)</p>
