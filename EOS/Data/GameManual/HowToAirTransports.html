<h1>How to pickup/dropoff units with Air Transports</h1>
<h2>There are several ways to pickup ground units with an air-transport.</h2>
<p>
Method #1: When your air-transport is landed inside a city, you can use the unit bar (on the top) to move ground units 
into the transport. Your city should contain the transport and the ground unit(s) you want to move into the transport.  
First, select the city.  In the unit bar, your city and it's contents will appear.  Then, drag and drop a ground unit 
onto the transport.
<br><br>
Method #2: If your ground unit is outside the city, select your air-transport.  Right click on the unit that should be picked up.

setup a waypoint).  Then, select the ground unit inside the transport, and right-click on the waypoint.
