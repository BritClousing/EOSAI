<H1>How Combat Works</H1>
<p>All units have a Combat type.  For example, the combat type of Infantry is "Soft".  And the combat type of tanks is "Armor". 
When units fight, their attack values are based on the enemy's combat type.  The defense value is constant with some modifiers for entrenchment and terrain. 
<br><br>
For example, if an infantry and a tank enter combat, the infantry has an to-hit of 4 against Armor, and a defense of 3.5. 
The tank has an to-hit of 5.5 against Soft, and a defense of 2.5.  Using these numbers, we can see that, on average, the infantry 
will hit the tank an average of 1.6 times each turn.  This is based on the infantry to-hit of 4 divided by the tanks defense of 2.5 
(4.0 / 2.5) = 1.6.  The tank will hit the infantry an average of 1.57 times per turn.  This is based on the tank to-hit of 5.5 
divided by the infantry's defense of 3.5.
<br><br>
Each turn of combat is broken up into 100 parts (called "tics").  So, when combat is calculated, it's calculated 100 times
each turn using the formula 0.01 x to-hit / defense.  The number of successful hits can vary from turn to turn.
<br><br>
If units have high attack values and low defense values, combat will occur quickly because each will hit multiple times
per turn.  If units have low attack values and high defense values, combat will occur slowly because it might take several turns
to score a single hit.  
<br><br>
When units hit, they generally cause 1 point of damage to each other, although this might vary depending on the rules.
