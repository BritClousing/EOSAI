<p>Cities serve multiple roles within a nation.
The most important role is that they produce new units and money.
It is important to control as many cities as possible as they are the sole source of production.  
The player with the most cities has a clear advantage over his opponents.
<br><br>
Cities serve as airports and harbors.  They are also strong defensive locations (+25% defense for all "soft" units inside the city).
<br><br>
Cities can also construct Buildings.  Buildings give cities extra advantages, such as extra production points, and the ability to upgrade and repair units.
<br><br>
When cities are attacked by artillery, bombers, or ship bombardment, some of the population turns into refugees.  Refugees do not contribute to the city's production.  For example, if a city has 12.0 population, but 2.0 refugees, then the city effectively has 10 population.  Refugees return to the city 
over time - generally 4-20 turns, depending on the number of refugees.  A city cannot have more than 75% refugees.  (For example, a city of 12.0 cannot have more than 9.0 refugees.)
<br><br>
Number of refugees: 1.0. Turns until all refugees return:  9. Total production lost (over 9 turns):   3.75<br>
Number of refugees: 2.0. Turns until all refugees return: 12. Total production lost (over 12 turns):  8.75<br>
Number of refugees: 4.0. Turns until all refugees return: 15. Total production lost (over 15 turns): 18.75<br>
Number of refugees: 8.0. Turns until all refugees return: 18. Total production lost (over 18 turns): 38.75<br>
<br>
Roughly speaking, each 1.0 refugees reduce production by a total of 5.0 points (spread over multiple turns).
