<p>Resources are required by your nation in order to build new units, maintain your current military, and research new technologies.
They can be gained by capturing resources on the map, traded with other players, or bought and sold on the 'open market'.
<br><br>
Resources can appear in land or water, and can be captured by sending a ground or sea unit to the resource's location to capture it.

<h2><img src="Resource-Oil.bmp" ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">Oil</h2>
<P>Cities and motorized units consume oil.  Cities consume oil in proportion to their size (0.1 oil per unit of population).  All units, except infantry, consume oil when they move.  
An oil shortage slows city production and limits unit movement.</P>

<h2><img src="Resource-Iron.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">Iron</h2>
<p>The creation of new units consumes iron.  An iron shortage slows or stops new unit production.</p>

<h2><img src="Resource-Food-Grain.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE"><img src="Resource-Food-Fish.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">Food</h2>
<p>Cities and units consume food.  A food shortage causes starvation in your cities, causing permanent population loss.  Cities consume Food in proportion to their size (0.1 Food per unit of population).</p>

<h2><img src="Resource-Gold.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">Gold</h2>
<p>Gold is converted into money.  Money is used to research new technologies and upgrade units.</p>
