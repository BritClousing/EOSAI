Terrain affects movement, combat, and maintenence costs for ground units.  Each ruleset is allowed
to define these values.  
<br><br>
When using the "Official 1900-2030" Ruleset, the types of terrain and their effects:
<br><br>
<img src="City.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Cities are good defensive locations for infantry (+50% Defense).<br>
<img src="Fortification-c.png" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Fortifications are good defensive locations for all ground units (+50% defense).<br>
<img src="Terrain-Road.png" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Roads provide a modest movement rate increase for infantry (+25%), and a large increase for vehicles (+100%).<br>
<img src="Terrain-Mountain.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Mountains are impassible to armored units (except via roads).  Infantry in mountains have a +25% defensive bonus, Vehicles suffer a -25% defensive penalty.<br>
<img src="Terrain-Forest.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Forest slows movement of vehicles (-50%) and causes a 25% defensive penalty.  Infantry get a +25% defensive bonus.<br>
<img src="Terrain-Plains.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Plains have no effect on movement or combat capabilities of units.<br>
<img src="Terrain-Desert.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Desert terrain decreases infantry defense (-25%) and increases maintenence costs on all ground units (+25%).<br>
<img src="Terrain-Arctic.bmp" BORDER=0 ALIGN="absMiddle">Arctic slows movement of all units (-50%) and increases maintenence costs (+50%).<br>
<br>
Units inside Cities and Fortifications use City and Fortification values, rather than the values of the surrounding terrain.
When units travel on roads, they use the movement rates of the "Road" terrain, but the combat
and maintenence values of the surrounding terrain.  For example, Armored units cannot travel through
the mountains, but they can travel on roads in those mountains.  When this occurs, Armored unit use 
the movement rates associates with roads, but the maintenence and combat values associated with 
mountains.
