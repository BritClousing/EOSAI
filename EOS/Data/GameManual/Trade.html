<H1>Trade</H1>
<P>There are two types of trade: trade on the "open market" and trade between nations.</p>
<H2>Trade on the Open Market</H2>
<P>Trade on the Open Market involves the buying or selling of resources (i.e. food, barrels of oil, iron).
The Open Market does not involve the transfer of resources or money to another player.  Instead, it acts as a place
which always buys and sells resources to the players at a fixed price.  Players can buy a resource for $3, or sell
a resource for $1.
</p>
<H2>Trade between Nations</H2>
<p>
Nations can trade with each other.  Trade between players involves not only the purchase or sale of resources, but
can involves a wide variety of items.  Items which can be offered:</p>
<P class="Bullet">Technology</p>
<P class="Bullet">Resources (the actual resource units, or the resource itself - e.g. barrels of oil or the oilfield)</p>
<P class="Bullet">Cities</p>
<P class="Bullet">Money</p>
<P class="Bullet">Units</p>
<P class="Bullet">Maps</p>
<P class="Bullet">Peace Treaty</p>
<P class="Bullet">Alliance</p>
<p>
Trade Agreements can be signed which involve the transfer of items each turn.  For example, a predefined amount of money,
resources (e.g. barrels of oil), and maps can be automatically transfered each turn.  The ongoing transfer of maps is 
especially useful for allies who are trying to coordinate their actions.
<br><br>
Using the trade system, it's possible for one nation to impose a levy on another nation.  For example, a stronger
nation might demand that another nation pay it $10 each turn for not invading.
