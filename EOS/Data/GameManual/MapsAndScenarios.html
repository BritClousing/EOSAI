<h1>Maps and Scenarios</h1>
<p>Games can be played on random maps (i.e. Maps that are generated "on the fly") or games can be played on pre-created
maps and pre-created scenarios.  Empires of Steel comes with a few maps and scenarios, but it is also possible to
download new maps and create your own through the Map Editor.</p>

<h2>Maps</h2>
<p>Maps contain terrain (water, forest, desert, etc), cities, resources, airfields, fortifications, and roads.  
Maps also include a set of player "Start Locations".  When a map-based game is played, a starting point is randomly 
assigned to each player, and players start with no technologies, units, or resources (except for the ones defined 
by the Ruleset).
<br><br>
An example of a Map might be a "World Map".  It would be setup with cities, resources, and a number of "Start Locations".
When players began the game, they would randomly be assigned a starting location from one of the existing ones.
</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>Scenarios are similar to maps except that they contain additional information.  In scenarios, there is a predefined
group of nations in the game.  Each nation's initial ownership of cities, resources, and units is defined by the scenario.
The scenario creator can also give certain technologies to players.  The purpose of scenarios is to allow 
players to create an initial state for a historical conflict.  For example, a World War 2 scenario might use a world map
and define 6 nations: United States, England, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Japan.  Each player begins the game
in control of one of those nations.
