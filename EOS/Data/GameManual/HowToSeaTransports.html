<h1>How to pickup/dropoff units with Sea Transports</h1>
<h2>There are several ways to pickup ground units with a sea unit.</h2>
<p>
Method #1: When your ship is docked inside a city, you can use the unit bar (on the top) to move ground units into the transport. 
Your city should contain the transport and the ground unit(s) you want to move into the transport.  First, select the city.  
In the unit bar, your city and it's contents will appear.  Then, drag and drop a ground unit into the transport.
<br><br>
Method #2: When your ship is docked inside a city, you can tell ground units (outside the city) to move into the transport. 
Select the ground unit, right click on the city, and a selection box will appear.  One of the options will be "Enter Transport". 
Choosing that option will give your ground unit orders to move to the city and enter the transport.
<br><br>
Method #3: When your ship is not docked in a city, right-click on a location near the coast. This will give your transport
orders to move to that location, and it will setup a waypoint.  Then, select a ground unit and right click on the waypoint. 
This will give your ground unit orders to board the transport at that location.

<h2>There are several ways to dropoff ground units from a sea unit.</h2>
<p>
Method #1: When your ship is docked inside a city, you can use the unit bar (on the top) to move ground units off the transport. 
First, select the city that contains the transport. In the unit bar, your city and it's contents will appear.  Then, 
drag and drop a ground unit off the transport.
<br><br>
Method #2: When your ship is not docked in a city, right-click on a location near the coast. This will give your transport
orders to move to that location, and it will setup a waypoint.  Then, select a ground unit (which is inside that transport) 
and right click on the waypoint. This will give your ground unit orders to exit the transport at that location.

<h2>There are several ways to land aircraft on a carrier.</h2>
<p>
Method #1: When your aircraft and carrier are inside a city, you can use the unit bar (on the top) to move aircraft into the carrier. 
First, select the city.  In the unit bar, your city and it's contents will appear.  Then, drag and drop an aircraft onto the carrier.
<br><br>
Method #2: When your carrier is docked inside a city, you can tell aircraft (which are outside the city) to move into the carrier. 
Select the aircraft, right click on the city, and a selection box will appear.  One of the options will be "Enter Carrier". 
Choosing that option will give your aircraft orders to move to the city and land on the carrier.
<br><br>
Method #3: When your carrier is not docked in a city, select your aircraft and right click on the carrier. 
This will give your aircraft orders to board the carrier.  (Warning: if your carrier is moving away from the aircraft, there is
a possibility that the carrier will move outside the movement range of the aircraft, causing it to crash.)

<h2>There are several ways to move aircraft off of carriers.</h2>
<p>
Method #1: When your carrier is inside a city, you can use the unit bar (on the top) to move aircraft off the carrier and into the city. 
First, select the city.  In the unit bar, your city and it's contents will appear.  Then, drag and drop an aircraft off of the carrier 
and onto the city.
<br><br>
Method #2: Select your carrier, and it will appear in the unit bar (on the top) along with its contents.  
Then, select your aircraft (using the unit bar) and give it orders to move somewhere.  This will make your aircraft take-off
from the carrier.
