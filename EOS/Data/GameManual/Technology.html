<p>Technology allows nations to gain improved units and abilities.  Nations must spend time and money
on research before new technologies become accessible.  When using the "Official 1900-2030" Ruleset, all players begin the
game with a level of technology roughly equivalent to the year 1900; the only aircraft are zeppelins,
internal combustion is relatively new, tanks have not been created, and ships still run on steam power.
Nations can learn new technologies such as flight, radar, and electronics.  New technologies will ultimately allow nations
to build drone aircraft, supercarriers, and nuclear weapons.
