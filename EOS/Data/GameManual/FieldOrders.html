<H1>Field Orders</H1>
<p>
Units will sometimes discover other player's units partway through a turn.  If you are at 
not at war with that player, your units will ignore them.  However, if you are at war with a 
player, field orders instruct your units on how they should react when they discover an enemy unit.

<img VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 src="%DataImages%/Tutorial-FieldOrders-MoveTo.png">
'Move To' tells your unit to ignore enemy units - they won't auto-attack.
<br><br>
<img VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 src="%DataImages%/Tutorial-FieldOrders-AttackWeaker.png">
'Attack Weaker' tells your unit to attack weaker enemy units.
<br><br>
<img VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 src="%DataImages%/Tutorial-FieldOrders-AttackAll.png">
'Attack All' tells your unit to attack all enemy units. (This can be useful when you want to clear an area of all enemy units.)
<br><br>
<img VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 src="%DataImages%/Tutorial-FieldOrders-AttackAir.png">
'Attack Air' tells your unit to attack air units. When air units are given this order, they will automatically intercept enemy air units.
<br><br>
<img VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 src="%DataImages%/Tutorial-FieldOrders-AttackSea.png">
'Attack Sea' tells your unit to attack sea units.
<br><br>
To change a unit's field orders, select the unit and then select the field order.  The field order 
will be shown just below the unit's flag.
