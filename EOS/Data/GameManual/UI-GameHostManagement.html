<h1>Game-Host Tools</h1>
<p>
The Game-Host Tools window lets the game host perform a number of actions.
<br><br>
* <b>Pause Game</b> Allows the game-host pause the game in timed-games.<br>
* <b>Transfer Game-Host</b> Allows the game-host to transfer server responsibilities to another player.  This is useful
if the game-host loses the game and wants to leave the game.<br>
* <b>Game Players</b> Lists the nations and who they are controlled by.  The interface lets the game-host can replace a human-player with 
an AI player.  This is useful if a player suddenly drops out of the game and other players want to continue the game without 
him. (This function only works if the human player is not connected.)<br>
* <b>Connected Players</b> Shows the list of players connected to the server, and which nation they are controlling.  (If a player
leaves the game and returns, the connected player will not be in control of any nations.)<br>
