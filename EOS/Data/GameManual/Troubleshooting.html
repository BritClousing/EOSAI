<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>Problem: When I click the "News/Updates" button, I get a "Page not found" error.</h2>
<p>There are two possible causes to this problem: either your computer is not connecting to the internet, or our servers
are down.  Try accessing the internet through a browser window (e.g. Internet Explorer or Firefox).</p>
<p class="Bullet">If you cannot connect, the problem is due to your connection. Try getting your internet connection working 
so that you can surf the internet.</p>
<p class="Bullet">If you can connect, it means that your connection should be working fine and the problem is that our servers are down.  
If the problem is with our servers, you may try to immediately connect again just in case it was a temporary glitch.
Also, the servers can be checked through a webbrowser by going to "www.AtomicboySoftware.com" or "www.EmpiresOfSteel.com".
Of one of the sites does not work, it serves as confirmation that our servers are down.</p>

<h2>Problems Hosting a Game on the Internet</h2>
<p>Hosting a game over the internet requires that incoming and outgoing data goes through your modem.  
Some modems (DSL and cable modems in particular) do what's called "Network Address Translation" (NAT).  
This can cause problems when receiving data over the internet.  When NAT is involved, players need to adjust some
setting of their modem so that they can host games on their computer.<br><br>

In order to host a game, your modem must be configured to do "Port Forwarding".
The following ports must be forwarded to the hosting computer: UDP port 60062 and TCP port 60062.
Failure to setup Port Forwarding will prevent users from connecting to games hosted on your computer.<br><br>

<h2>Voicechat Doesn't Work</h2>
<p>Voicechat requires a headset (or speakers and a microphone).  Make sure the microphone is plugged into the correct
input connection in your computer.  Additionally, voicechat problems may occur over low-bandwidth connections (like a 56K modem).
Low bandwidth connections may lack the ability to send and receive voicechat information.
<br><br>
If you can hear other players through voicechat, but they can't hear you, it might be due to the setup of Windows' sound input device.
