<p>
<b>Upgrades From</b>
<br>
This is the unit that can upgrade to the current unit.
<br><br>
<b>Upgrades To</b>
<br>
With the right technology research, this unit can upgrade to this unit.  Upgrades have a cost associated
with them, in terms of money, iron, and time.  Most units can upgrade within a single turn, but some large
units (e.g. Battleships) require multiple turns to be upgraded.
<br><br>
<b>Movement Type</b>
<br>
All units have a movement type.  The movement type determines the unit's movement-rate multiplier
when moving through terrain, as well as their maintenence cost in various types of terrain.
<br><br>
(The exact effects of terrain are determined by the current rules.  To view this information in 
the game-manual, go to the <a href="page:Contents.html">Contents</a> page, pick a rulset under 
"Rules" and click "Terrain".)
<br><br>
<b>Combat Type</b>
<br>
All units have a combat type.  The combat type determines the unit's defense multiplier
when in different types of terrain.  It also determines which category enemy units use when attacking
this unit.  For example, an anti-aircraft gun might have good attack values against the "Aircraft" combat
category, but very bad attack values against the "Submarine" combat category.
<br><br>
(The exact effects of terrain are determined by the current rules.  To view this information in 
the game-manual, go to the <a href="page:Contents.html">Contents</a> page, pick a rulset under 
"Rules" and click "Terrain".)
<br><br>
<b>Tags</b>
<br>
Some units have "tags".  Units are allowed to have an unlimited number of tags.  Tags are used for 
several different things in the game.
<br><br>
Tags are used by the rules-system to determine which units are allowed to travel
inside other units.  For example, the "Transport (Class 1)" unit is allowed to carry units which have
"Infantry", "LightVehicle", or "HeavyVehicle" tags.  Transport Aircraft, on the other hand, can only 
carry units that have the "Paratrooper" tag.  (Paratroopers contain the "Infantry" and "Paratrooper" tags, 
meaning that they can travel in both types of transports.)
<br><br>
Tags can also be used to determine sighting range.  Most aircraft have the "RadarVisible" tag.  A "SAM Vehicle
(Class 2)" has a default view range of 60 pixels, but a "RadarVisible" view range of 120, allowing it to see
aircraft that are farther away.  In other cases, the tags can reduce a unit's visibility.  Submarine units 
have a "Submarine" tag, and their visibility is reduced below a unit's normal view range.  For example, 
transports have a default view range of 60 pixels, but their Submarine view range is zero, meaning they 
cannot see submarines at all.
<br><br>
<b>Cost / Production</b>
<br>
The production cost is the amount of production that must be spent to build a unit inside a city.
<br><br>
<b>Cost / Iron</b>
<br>
The iron cost is the amount of iron that must be spent to build a unit.
<br><br>
<b>Maintenence / Food (per turn)</b>
<br>
All units consume a certain amount of food each turn.
<br><br>
<b>Maintenence / Oil (per turn of movement)</b>
<br>
Most units consume oil when moving.  To avoid this cost, players can avoid moving their units.
<br><br>
<b>Building Prerequisites</b>
<br>
Some units require certain city improvements before they can be built.  For example, Battleships cannot
be built inside a city unless there is a Shipyard in the city.
<br><br>
<b>View Range</b>
<br>
View Range describes the range that this unit can see other units.  For example, "Artillery (Class 1)" has
a default view range of 60 pixels, and a "submarine" view range of 0, meaning that it can't see submarines.
<br><br>
<b>Movement</b>
<br>
Movement Rate: This is the base movement rate of the unit.  Terrain can increase or decrease this unit's actual movement rate.
<br><br>
Movement Limit: Air units have a movement-limit.  This is the maximum distance they can move before running out
of fuel and crashing.
<br><br>
<b>Attack</b>
<br>
The attack values describe this unit's attack ability against each combat-category.  These values
describe the chances of hitting the target during one turn of combat.  
<br><br>
For example, the "Battleship (Class 3)" has an attack value against "Submarine" is 10.0 to-hit.  This 
determines the likelihood of hitting a submarine within one turn of combat; this value is not very useful 
in itself because the submarine's defense value lowers the to-hit value.  A "Submarine (Class 3)" has
a defense value of 1.4.  On average, a Battleship (Class 3) will hit a Submarine (Class 3) for 
10.0 / 1.4 = 7.14 HP/turn.  A submarine (Class 4) has a higher defense value of 1.6, meaning that
a Battleship (Class 3) will hit a Submarine (Class 4) for 10.0 / 1.6 = 6.25 HP/turn (on average).
<br><br>
Combat ranges determine the distance at which units can attack each other.  There are several types of ranges.
<br><br>
Range: Unit+50 - "Unit Range" is 40, so Unit+50 = the unit can attack units at a range of 90.<br>
Range: 50 - The unit can attack units at a range of 50.<br>
Range: AtTarget - The unit must be directly over the target to attack (aircraft and missiles must be directly over the target).
<br><br>
Attack vs City<br>
<u>SubTargeting: Random</u> - Subtargeting is used to determine which city component gets attacked (population, city improvement, or in-production item).<br>
<u>Population Killed: 0.80 / 0.1</u> - The first number is the chances of hitting the population (80%), and the second number is the number of population killed.
For example, a nuclear ICBM has population killed value of "1.00 / 6.0" meaning that when a nuke explodes, there is a 100% chance that 
the 6.0 population will be killed.<br>
<u>Destroy Buildings: 0.80 / 1</u> - The first number is the chances of hitting a city improvement (80%), and the second number is the number of buildings destroyed (1).<br>
<u>Damage Production: 0.80 / 30</u> - The first number is the chances of hitting the in-production item (80%), and the second number is the amount of damage done to the item (30).
(A successful hit against production would set-back the city's current production item by 30 production.)
<br><br>
<b>Defense</b>
<br>
A unit's defense value affect how likely a unit is to be hit.  A value of 2.0 means a unit is half as likely
to be hit as a unit with a defense of 1.0.  A unit's current terrain affects its defense value.  Aircraft and
ships have a "Landed or Docked" defense value, which is much lower than its normal defense value.
<br><br>
<b>HP</b>
<br>
HP stands for "Hit Points".  This is the number of hits a unit can take before being destroyed.  Hit Points
can be repaired if the unit is inside a city with the appropriate city improvements.  For example, a damaged
tank can be repaired at a rate of 1HP / turn when it's inside a city with a Barracks.  Aircraft Carriers
are also capable of repairing landed aircraft.
<br><br>
<b>Special Abilities</b>
<br>
Some units have special abilities.<br>
Can Build Airfields - if a unit can build an airfield, the time-to-build is listed.  The cost to build airfields
is determined by the ruleset.
<br><br>
<b>Containment</b>
<br>
Units have a certain size when inside a container.  Under the Official 1900-2030 rules, most units have a size
of 1.  The "Transport (Class 2)" has a containment size of 3, meaning it can contain 3 units of size 1.
If a unit is capable of containing units, there is also a list of unit-tags that can be inside this unit.
<br><br>
<b>Combat Value</b>
<br>
Because of the incomplete nature of the attack to-hit values, the combat value section was created to 
display the combat usefulness against a variety of targets.
<br><br>
Attrition: The attrition value ranges from 0-100.  This value is calculated using a the production costs
of the current unit, the production cost of the target unit, and the average combat results.  An attrition
of 50 means that the units are equally matched.  An infantry attacking an identical infantry unit would have
an attrition value of 50.  Higher attrition values are better; it means that this unit will, on average,
inflict more damage (in terms of production cost) on the enemy than vice-versa.  
<br><br>
For example, if two units are equally matched in combat, but Unit 2 costs twice as much to build as Unit 1,
then Unit 1 will have an attrition value of 67% against Unit 2, and Unit 2 will have an attrition cost of 33%
against Unit 1.
<br><br>
There are some complications to the attrition value, however.
<br><br>
Attrition will not tell you who will win a fight.  For example, a small, cheap unit (say, 50 production) 
might have a very good attrition value against a large, expensive unit (say, 500 production).  But, combat 
might usually result in the small, cheap unit being destroyed (50 production lost) and the large unit being
reduced to half-hitpoints (500 production/2 = 250 production damage).  However, if both sides have spent
equal amounts of money on units (player 1 bought 10 cheap, high-attrition units; player 2 bought 1 expensive,
low-attrition unit), then attrition values will give you an idea who will come out ahead after combat.
<br><br>
Attrition ignores the fact that certain units can be repaired.  If you cause 100 production damage to an
enemy, but he goes home and get repaired, then it's not really "real" damage (although, it might cost him
some repair time).
<br><br>
Attrition also can't fully take into account the advantages and disadvantages of ranged combat.  If an infantry
unit is entrenched, and an enemy artillery bombards the infantry (from outside the infantry's counterattack
range), then the artillery really has a 100 attrition value against infantry.  But, if that infantry goes
after the artillery, the artillery's attrition value is much lower because, while it gets some free attacks 
as the infantry moves in for the attack, it will be in trouble once the infantry reaches combat range.
In a more complex example, a group of five artillery might always destroy an infantry as it moves in to attack,
meaning that artillery effectively have a 100 attrition against a single infantry.
