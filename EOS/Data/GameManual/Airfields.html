<p>Airfields serve as take-off and landing locations for aircraft.  They can be built anywhere on the map, except on
mountains, cities, resources, fortifications, and water.  Airfields can be built by some ground units, usually infantry.
<br><br>
To build an airfield, select a unit that can build them.  Press the "Airfield" button (just above the map window), 
then move your cursor over the map.  The cursor will change to a small building in areas where you can build an airfield, and
a building with a red 'x' in locations where you can't build an airfield.  Right click on the location where you want to 
build the airfield.  Once your infantry arrives there, it will take 5 turns to build.
