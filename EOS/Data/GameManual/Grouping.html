<p>Units can be grouped together and commanded as one unit.</p>
<br>
<p>To group units together, they must be in the same location (e.g. inside a city), and of the same type 
(ground, air, water units).  Then, on the 'unit bar', left click one unit and drag it onto the other one.
This will create a group.  Any number of units can be combined together into a group.</p>

<p>The display of the group on the unit-bar can be altered by clicking on the "collapse" button 
(the '+' in the lower left corner of the group).</p>
<br>
<p>The movement abilities of the group depends on the units inside it.  The group moves as slow as the slowest unit, and
(when the unit contains ranged units) the group's movement range is the same as the shortest-ranged unit.</p>
