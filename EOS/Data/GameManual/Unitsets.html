<h1>Rulesets</h1>
<p>Rulesets define many of the rules of the game, including:</p>
<p class="Bullet">What Units, Technologies, and Buildings are available in the game.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Attributes of the Units, Technologies, and Buildings (cost, movement speed, combat values, etc).</p>
<p class="Bullet">The structure of the technology tree.</p>
<p class="Bullet">What Units and Technologies are given to players at beginning of the game.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Whether any nations have any special units or technologies that are available only to that nation.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, theoretically, a ruleset could be created which defines:</p>
<p class="Bullet">The technologies and units available to the US and Vietnam sides during the Vietnam war.</p>
<p class="Bullet">The units and technologies available to each of the nations involved in World War 2 between 1939 and 1945, including
Tiger tanks and Stuka Bombers for Germans, Sherman tanks for Americans, a Japanese "Kamikazi" unit, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Empires of Steel comes with two rulesets: the "Official 1900-2030" ruleset and the "Official 1940" ruleset.  New rulesets
can be downloaded or uploaded from the internet.
