<H1>What is Attrition?</H1>
<p>Attrition is a high-level concept involving the combat balance between units. It combines the attack, defense, and build-cost of units together to figure out what units should be used against which units.
<br><br>
For example, let's say that an infantry has 1 HP and costs 10 production.  A tank has 2 HP and costs 20 production.  If, on average, 
the infantry receives 1 HP of damage while causing 1 HP of damage to the tank, then each of them cause 10 production worth of 
damage to each other in combat.  They are equally matched from an attrition standpoint.
<br><br>
Attrition can give players an idea how to spend their production when creating new units.  It's a measure of "how much bang for
the buck" do players get by building particular units.  To put it another way, if one player spends 500 production building 
unit A, and another player spends 500 production on unit B, attrition will tell you who will have units standing
after combat is done.
<br><br>
The attrition rating does not take the possibility of repairs into account.  For example, if tanks can be repaired, while 
infantry cannot, then tanks have an edge over infantry.  The attrition rating does not take repairs into account because 
whether or not a player is capable of repairing his units will depend on the particular situation.  For example, if one 
player has 20 infantry, and the second player has 3 tanks, then what will happen is that the tanks will be defeated in 
combat without any chance to get repaired.
<br><br>
Attrition also doesn't tell you who will win the combat.  For example, using fictional combat numbers, if one player has a 
destroyer (2HP, 20 production cost) and he sends it against an aircraft carrier (8HP, 200 production cost), the destroyer might
cause 6 damage against the aircraft carrier before being sunk.  In this case, the player with the destroyer lost 20 production
while the player with the carrier lost 150 production (i.e. 6/8 HP x 200 production).  From an attrition standpoint, this combat
would strongly favor the destroyer, even though the combat will result in the aircraft carrier winning the battle.
<br><br>
How Attrition is calculated
<br><br>
Attrition is calculated by using the average amount of damage caused on each side.  If a unit has 8 HP, and it costs 80 production
to build it, then each HP is "worth" 10 production points.  If combat causes an average of 2.5 damage, then it causes 25 production
worth of damage.  If unit A receives 10 production damage when unit B receives 20 production damage, then the attrition value would
be 66 for unit A, and 33 for unit B.  This is based on the forumla 10/(10+20) = 10/30 = 0.33.
<br><br>
Attrition can be difficult to calculate when units are involved in ranged combat.  If an infantry is entrenched in a location and
never moves and an artillery starts attacking him, then the attrition rating of the artillery is 100.  It will never receive damage
from the infantry because he is outside the combat range.  However, if the infantry moves within combat range to attack the artillery,
he will defeat the artillery, which is weak in direct combat.  In that case, attrition strongly favors the infantry.
