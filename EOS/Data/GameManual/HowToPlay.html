<H1>How to Play Empires of Steel</H1>
<img src="Screenshot23.png" HSPACE=10 ALIGN="RIGHT" >
<p>Empires of Steel is a turn-based wargame.  
Players take the role of a dictator/general in control of a nation and commanding military forces against other nations. 
The goal of the game is to take control of the game world, either as a single player or as a team.
<br><br>
In a typical game, each player begins the game in control of a single, small, island nation.  
Each nation’s technology is roughly equivalent to technology in the year 1900, and players will
know very little about the world around them.  The first thing player will want to do is find 
and capture the cities and resources around them.  Cities are used to construct new military units, which
are used to fight other nations and capture new cities.  Resources, including oil, food, and iron, are used
to support a nation's cities and military.
<br><br>
<h2>Diplomacy</h2>
<p>
In multiplayer games, you will gain a great deal by forming alliances and non-aggression pacts
with other players.  This becomes especially important as the number of players increases.
Forming these relationships can allow you to attack a third player, allow you to reduce your
defenses along your common border, and engage in mutually benefitial trade.
</P>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>
Your nation needs raw resources.  Food and Oil is required by your cities and military.
Iron is necssary for construction of new units.  Money is needed for research.
Shortages of these three resources can undercut your military strength; Oil shortages reduce your 
cities’ production capability and slow your units, food shortages can cause famine which 
permanently weakens your cities and units, and iron shortages prevent the construction of 
new units.  A lack of money harms technology research and prevents the upgrading of units.
All resources can be bought or sold for money.
</P>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>
When the game begins, each player starts with technology roughly equivalent to technology in the 
year 1900.  Nations can spend money to learn new technologies, providing it with better units.  
Failure to research new technology can lead to a situation where one nation futilely sends outdated
units against another nation's advanced weapons.

<h2><img src="City.bmp" ALIGN="MIDDLE">Cities</h2>
<p>
Cities are the production centers of nations.  They can produce new units and money.
They are the most important piece in the game, so players should attempt to control
as many cities as possible.</p>

<h2><img src="Resource-Oil.bmp" ALIGN="MIDDLE">Resources</h2>
<p>
Resources are raw materials consumed by nations.
<p class="Bullet">Oil is consumed by cities and units.  Units only consume oil when they move, so one way to
conserve oil is to avoid moving units.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Food is consumed by cities and units.  A shortage leads to permanent damage of cities and units.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Iron is used when building new units.  A shortage of iron prevents construction of new units.</p>
<p class="Bullet">Gold is turned into money.  Money is used for technology research, unit upgrades, and can be
used to buy and sell other resources.</p>

<p>
Infantry units can build airfields.  They serve as take-off and landing locations for aircraft.
Airfields are a useful way for nations to extend the range their airforce.

<h2><img src="Unit-TankG3.bmp" ALIGN="MIDDLE">Units</h2>
<p>
Units are the basic military game piece.  Units are used to capture new cities, resources, and ultimately,
win the game.  Initially, players will have access to a few, relatively primitive units.
As a nation's technology grows, it gains access to faster, more powerful units.  

Players will initially start with two ground units (infantry, artillery), one air unit (zeppelin), and
several ships (destroyer, cruiser, transport, freighter).
