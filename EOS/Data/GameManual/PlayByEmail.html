<H1>Play By Email</H1>

<p>Play-by-email is a type of game where players do not need to be online at the same time to play a game together. 
One player can open his game, setup his orders (which get automatically uploaded), and then leave. Once all the players
have submitted their turns, the game-host processes the turn.  The results of the turn are automatically uploaded.  Players
can then load their game (which automatically downloads the latest game-state) and setup their orders for the next turn.</p>

<h2>Starting a play-by-email game:</h2>

<p>Let's say three people want to start a play-by-email (PBEM) game - Adam, Brian, and Chris.
<br><br>
Adam is going to host the PBEM game, so he starts a new game by selecting Multiplayer > PBEM Games > New Game (Create).  He clicks 
on the Player #2 slot, selects "PBEM Player" and types in "Brian" at the prompt.  Then clicks on the Player #3 slot, selects 
"PBEM Player" and types in "Chris" at the prompt.  (Adam can change his player name by clicking on Player 1 slot and selecting 
"Local Player".)
<br><br>
Adam then clicks the "Ok" button to start the game. Now, a new window appears.  He can accept the default name or type in a new
one.  He copies the player keys out of the window.  They are "Epsilon2-Mar8-P02:4642" and "Epsilon2-Mar8-P03:1647".  These keys
will be used by the other players to connect to the game.  The code "Epsilon2-Mar8-P02:4642" is given to Brian, and code 
"Epsilon2-Mar8-P03:1647" to Chris.
<br><br>
When Adam's game starts, the application uploads copies of the game for the other players
<br><br>
Brian opens the game, and selects Multiplayer > PBEM Games > New Game (Join).  In the window, he types in his code "Epsilon2-Mar8-P02:4642". 
This causes the game to download his game from the internet server, and then Brian's game begins.
<br><br>
<h2>Playing the game:</h2>

<p>The application automatically uploads and downloads events from the internet server, so players don't need to pass around files. 
Players just need to open their game and all the events get downloaded and processed.  Once a player sets up his orders, he presses
the "submit orders" button.  This uploads the orders to the internet server.  He can then close his game.
<br><br>
Once the game-host receives orders from the other players, he can open his game and press the "Process Turn" button.  After the
turn is processed, it gets uploaded to the server.
<br><br>
If one or more players haven't submitted their orders, and the game-host decides to proceed with the game, he can press the 
"Process Turn" button to force the turn to be processed.
</p>

<h2>Empires of Steel Messenger:</h2>
<p>The EOS Messenger application is used to track what is going on inside a game.  It allows players to see if someone has sent them
a message, or declared war without requiring them to open the full application.
<br><br>
When players create or join a PBEM game, the game automatically gets added to the list of games tracked by the Messenger.
