<b>Map/Scenario Editor</b>
<br><br>
The built-in map and scenario editor lets players create their own maps and scenarios.  Maps define the geography and placement 
of cities and resources.  An example of a map is a map of the earth - there  are no predefined nations; just continents, cities, 
resources, and terrain.  Scenarios are like maps, except they let the user setup nations - who owns which cities, what units they control, 
and what technologies they know.  An example of a scenario would be a World War 2 scenario - a world map with five 
predefined players: German, Japanese, American, British, and Soviet, along with the cities, units, and technologies
appropriate to each player.

<b>Ruleset Editor</b>
<br><br>
The built-in ruleset editor lets players create their own technology trees and units.  For example, a ruleset might 
define technologies appropriate to a World War 2 simulation by defining technologies and units available during the 
1939-1945 period.  It's even possible to create nation-specific units and technologies - for example, a Kamikazi unit
available exclusively to the Japanese.

user-created content, which helps identify the best user-content for new users.
