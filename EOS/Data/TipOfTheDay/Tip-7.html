Did you know that the icon next to the "Submit Orders" button tells you how many players have submitted their turns?<br><br>

<img align=left VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 src="%BaseDir%\Data\TipOfTheDay\SubmitOrdersTicker2.png">
To see detailed information on which players have submitted their turns, hover your mouse over the icon, and detailed information will appear in the tooltip.<br><br>

This information is especially useful during multiplayer games, if you want to see who hasn't submitted their turn yet.</p>
