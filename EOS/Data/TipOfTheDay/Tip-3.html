<p>Did you know that you can scroll the map without using the scrollbars?<br><br></p>
<p>Place the mouse over the game map, hold the scroll-wheel down and move the mouse.<br><br></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can place the mouse over the game map, click the scroll-wheel and the map will zoom out.  Move the mouse to a new location, and click the middle-mouse button again.  This will zoom in to the new location.<br><br></p>
<p>You can also move the main map around by left-clicking on the mini-map shown in the upper left corner of the main window.<br><br></p>
