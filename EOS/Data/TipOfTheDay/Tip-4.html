<p>Did you know that you can group units together?<br><br></p>
<p>To group units together, down-click on one unit and drag the mouse cursor on top of another unit.  In order to be grouped, the units must be in the same location.  They also have to be of the same general type (ground units with ground units, sea units with sea units, etc).<br></p>

<p><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
<p><img VSPACE=5 HSPACE=5 src="%BaseDir%\Data\GameManual\GroupingExample.gif"></p>
<p></TD></TR></TABLE></p>

<p>When units are grouped together, they can be given orders as if they were one unit.<br><br></p>
<p>The '+' button in the lower left corner of the group lets you change how the group appears on the unit bar.<br><br></p>
