<p>Did you know that the city-build map will show you what each city is building, and how many turns until it is completed?<br><br>

To see the city-build map, press the 'Reports' tab in the lower-left corner of the main window. Then, press the "City View" button. Press it again to return to the normal map view.<br><br></p>
