Can the game derive a new class from AIPlayer? In what cases would that be useful/important?

Conversion routines:

You'll need to convert all the game objects into a format that the AI understands.
The AI uses AIUnit, AICity, AIResource, AIAirfield, AIFort to represent the game-objects
The map must also be converted into an AI representation using AIRegion and MultiRegion objects.
