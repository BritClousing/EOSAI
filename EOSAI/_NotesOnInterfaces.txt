When integrating AIPlayer2Interface into your software, you should avoid changing the interfaces themselves.
If you need additional functionality, your classes should derive from AIPlayer2Interface and your class should add new virtual functions.
You'll need to link to those objects in both the EOSAI project and your own project.

Conversion routines:

You'll need to convert all the game objects into a format that the AI understands.
The AI uses AIUnit, AICity, AIResource, AIAirfield, AIFort to represent the game-objects
The map must also be converted into an AI representation using AIRegion and MultiRegion objects.
