EOSAI
Genie
FrostGiant / IceGiant
IronGiant - the problem is that the movie name might be too common. Maybe "Iron Giant AI" works. I don't know.
Goliath
Gorilla
Hydra
Titan - various references to Titan AI in Age of Mythology and Titanfall
HiveMind - a AI mod for Half-Life exists with this name
OverMind - There's an Overmind AI that won the Starcraft competition 2010 (It's worth reading what they did to create the Berkley Overmind)
Alive
Golem - interesting etymology, but in folklore, golems are generally not very smart. Maybe an early release name?

I could use a variety of "release" names (like how Android names their versions): 
  Smart Fictional Characters: Stark, Loki, Octavius (DoctorOctopus), Sherlock, Xavier, Gandolf, DoctorWho, DocBrown, Banner (Hulk), Wayne (Batman), LexLuthor, 
    Megamind, Syndrome (Incredibles), Doctor Strange,
  Smart Robots: Ultron, T-1000, CP3O, R2D2, Weyland/David (Aliens), ED-209
  Conquerors: Ghenghis Khan (Ghengis or Khan), Ulysses
  Smart People: Musk, Tesla, Edison
  Smart/Powerful Monsters: MindFlayer, Githyanki, Cthulu, Naga, Hydra (interesting if this was a multithreaded release), Cerebus, Yeti, Sashquatch, Lich, Wraith
  Monsters: Golem (interesting because it sort of fits, but they aren't that smart. Early release?)
