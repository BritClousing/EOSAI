// General desires have no location associated with them.
//   It can include "more technology", "strategic bombing [anywhere]", etc.
// I don't know if I'll keep/use this class, but it might be useful for general strategies.
//   Example: if the enemy has no air-defense, then the desire for strategic bombing is higher because
//     he's an easy target and because it might force him into building air-defense which distracts
//     him from building other units.
